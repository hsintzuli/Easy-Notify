- #### Scale Out Web-Push Worker by Using AWS Lambda      <a align='right' href="./docs/webpush-lambda.md" target="_blank">  üìãRead More</a>
   The concurrency executions of the AWS Lambda function enable Easy-Notify to send notifications to at least **1,200 * 20** subscribers in 15 minutes. At the same time, the exact number could be more extensive than 24,000 because of the maximum 1,000 concurrency executions of the AWS Lambda function.

- #### Scalability of Socket.IO Server      <a align='right' href="./docs/socketio-scaling.md" target="_blank">  üìãRead More</a>

   - **Load Test on Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling**  
      Vertical Scaling is capable of maintaining a higher maximum concurrency connection than Horizontal Scaling.

      </p>  

   - **Auto Scaling by AWS Application Load Balancer**  
      ALB successfully scaled out the auto scaling groups after the concurrency connections reached approximately 21,000.

- #### Record the ACK Response on Redis    <a align='right' href="./docs/notification-related_mechanism.md/#record-ack-response-on-redis" target="_blank">  üìãRead More</a>
   Rotate two HashMaps on Redis to record the ack responses from subscribers
